Reversing a linked list using 2 pointers using XOR :

https://iq.opengenus.org/reverse-linked-list-using-2-pointers-xor/

We reverse a given linked list by link reversal and not by swapping the values of the nodes in the linked list.
The common technique to reverse a linked list involves using 3 pointers.
But by using properties of the xor operation, we learn to reverse the linked list with only 2 pointers.
