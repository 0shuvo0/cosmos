# Topological Sort

A topological sort is a simple algorithm that outputs the linear ordering of vertices/nodes of a DAG(Directed Acyclic Graph), where for each directed edge from node A to node B(A :arrow_right: B), node A appears before node B in ordering.

## Condition:
1. The graphs should be **directed**, otherwise for any two vertices a & b, there would be two paths from a to b & vice-versa, & hence they cannot be ordered.

2. The graphs should be **acyclic**, otherwise for any three vertices a,b,c on a cycle, there will not be any starting point, & hence, linear ordering can't be done.

> Note: Via this algorithm, multiple orderings are possible.

For example:

Here, V1, V2, V3, V4 and V1, V3, V2, V4 are possible orderings.

## Time Complexity:
The time comlexity of this algorithm is : O(|V|+|E|) & this is the case, when we use slightly modified adjacency linked list.
Where, V: No. of vertices & E: No. of edges.

To be more precise, we can get topologically sorted list in two ways:
1. **Adjacency matrix:** 
In this case, it'll take O(|V|^2) time to find all vertices in graph with no predecessors.
2. **Adjacency list:** 
In this case, weâ€™ll need O(|E|) time. Thus, in worst case, it again takes (|V|^2) time for the same.

So, to optimize the algorithm, we slightly modify adjacency list implementation, by adding two lists to store both outgoing & incoming edges, inorder to find nodes with no predecessors & hence, we get better performance with time complexity: O(|V| + |E|).
