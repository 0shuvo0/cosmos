# Newman-Conway Number  
Newman-Conway numbers is the one which generates the following integer sequence.
1 1 2 2 3 4 4 4 5 6 7 7â€¦.  

## Recurrence relation.  
`P(1) = 1,`  
`P(2) = 1,`  
`P(n) = P (P(n-1) ) + P( n - P(n-1) )`  

## Time Complexity
To compute n<sup>th</sup> Newman-Conway Number.  
`T(n) = O(n)`
