Reversing a Doubly Linked List in C++

In this article, we see how to reverse a doubly linked list by reversing the links of each node (without swapping values of nodes) 
and have implemented the solution using C++
* Doubly Linked lists have an extra pointer to store the address of the previous node. This allows both forward and backward traversal in a doubly linked list. 
* Doubly Linked lists have two links for each node and to reverse the list, we have to reverse both the links

To reverse a doubly linked list, we make use of 2 pointers for the link reversal, unlike reversing a singly linked list which requires 3 pointers (without using xor)
