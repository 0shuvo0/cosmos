Binary search is a specialized algorithm.It takes advantage of data that has been sorted in an array or a list.
Binary search is used on sorted arrays,and it more often when used with binary search trees 
There is a dramatic speed enhancement in the runtime as the time complexity of binary search is  O(log(n)),where n is the number of elements being searched.
